Entry level IT Engineer Consultant, Developer in computer sciences.  

I am a French informatician recently finished my work/ apprentice contract (end of August) and I just moved to Cluj-Napoca in the end of September in order to continue my professional career in informatics. Therefore, while I was on my Erasmus program, I saw a lot of potential in the IT field here in Cluj and this is why I want to find a good job in development and then grow up in professional terms and evolve my skills in management and consulting.
I am looking for a job in English or French languages (until I am learning Romanian very well).
